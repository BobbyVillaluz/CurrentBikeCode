# Documentation
The main code that runs on our Arduino Due is composed of the following modules:
* [Front Motor Controller/Encoder](https://github.com/CornellAutonomousBikeTeam/CurrentBikeCode/blob/master/README.md#front_motor_controller/encoder)
* [Rear Motor Controller](https://github.com/CornellAutonomousBikeTeam/CurrentBikeCode/blob/master/README.md#rear_motor_controller)
* [RC Controller](https://github.com/CornellAutonomousBikeTeam/CurrentBikeCode/blob/master/README.md#rccontroller)
* [GPS](https://github.com/CornellAutonomousBikeTeam/CurrentBikeCode/blob/master/README.md#gps)
* [Landing Gear](https://github.com/CornellAutonomousBikeTeam/CurrentBikeCode/blob/master/README.md#landinggear)
* [IMU (Intertial Measurement Unit)](https://github.com/CornellAutonomousBikeTeam/CurrentBikeCode/blob/master/README.md#imu)
* [Watchdog](https://github.com/CornellAutonomousBikeTeam/blob/CurrentBikeCode/master/README.md#watchdog)
The Bike_State.ino file contains the defintiion for the Bike object that is intiialized and run in the main file. ROS communication is implemented in the main file.
